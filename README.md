Sentiment Analysis using NLP
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis, aiming to classify text reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

Overview
The project implements sentiment analysis through various NLP methods and techniques, primarily using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM layers. It involves data preprocessing, encoding text, model building, and prediction.

Key Features
Bag of Words: Demonstrates a basic approach to text encoding using word frequency.
Word Embedding: Utilizes word embeddings for more meaningful text representations.
LSTM Model: Implements a sequential model using LSTM layers for context understanding.
Sentiment Prediction: Predicts sentiment based on the trained model.
